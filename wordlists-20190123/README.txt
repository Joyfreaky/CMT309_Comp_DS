These wordlists are uncompressed DOS/Windows format text files (lines
are terminated with CR-LF pairs).  They are directly usable with most
password crackers and password recovery utilities on Windows, Mac, and
Unix systems.

In particular, John the Ripper is smart enough to correctly process
(uncompressed) text files even if they use linefeed conventions that
don't match those of the host OS.
